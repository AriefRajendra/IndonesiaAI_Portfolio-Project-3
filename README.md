## Project 3: House Price Prediction

The House Price Prediction Project is part of Indonesia AI's Bootcamp Portfolio Project, which tasks students with developing machine learning algorithms to forecast house prices in Ames, Iowa. The dataset consists of 2,930 observations and 79 features.

To predict the housing prices, my team utilized six machine learning algorithms, namely Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Artificial Neural Networks. I was tasked with the implementation of all models except the AdaBoost and LightGBM. 

## Getting Started

You can easily implement the code in this repository by:

1. Cloning this project
2. Set up Python and Jupyter Notebook locally, either directly from Python or using Anaconda, or you can use Google Colab if you wish to have faster processing without a local GPU
3. Make sure that you have installed the required packages that are included at the start of the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file
4. Run the code as is, or add your modifications

## The Result

Our estimations find that the XGBoost model significantly outperforms all other models, and should be used for further predictions.
